This project uses a custom-trained AI model for image recognition, built using Teachable Machine to classify images as either Hotdog or Banana. The trained model is exported and used in a Python script with TensorFlow/Keras.

Project Overview
Goal: Train a simple AI model to recognize whether an image is a hotdog or a banana.

Tools Used:
Teachable Machine
TensorFlow
Keras
Python

Model Training
The model was trained using Google's Teachable Machine:
Two classes: Hotdog and Banana
Images were uploaded manually for both classes
Exported the trained model as a TensorFlow (Keras) .h5 file
